Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.1 Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. It ensures software 
is reliable, scalable, and meets user requirements. The importance of it in technology is that it drives innovation in technology,ensures softwear 
quality,security, and maintainability as well as managing complexities in large- scale projects and reduces risks like system failures.

  1.2 Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 In 1960s: Structured Programming introduced modular code design.   (e.g., ALGOL, Pascal)
-   1980s: Object-Oriented Programming  enabled reusable, organized code.  (e.g., C++, Java)
-   2001: Agile Manifesto shifted focus to iterative development and customer collaboration.  

1.3 List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 Requirements Gathering:  Define user needs and system specifications.  
 Design: Plan architecture, databases, and interfaces.  
 Implementation: Code the software.  
 Testing: Validate functionality and fix defects.  
 Deployment: Release to users.  
 Maintenance: Update and improve post-launch.

1.4 Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall                                                     Agile 

Linear, sequential phases.                                    Iterative, incremental cycles (sprints).  
Rigid requirements.                                           Flexible to changes. 
Example: Building a banking system with fixed regulations.    Example: Developing a startup app with evolving user feedback.


1.5 Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer: Writes code, implements features, and debugs.  
- QA Engineer: Designs test cases, identifies bugs, and ensures quality.  
- Project Manager: Coordinates timelines, resources, and stakeholder communication.

1.6 Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of 
each.

- IDEs
  (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm):
 Streamline coding with syntax highlighting, debugging, and plugins.
  
- VCS
  (e.g., Git, SVN):
  Track changes, enable collaboration, and revert to previous versions.
  
1.7 What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Changing Requirements: Use Agile to adapt incrementally.  
- Technical Debt: Schedule regular refactoring.  
- Tight Deadlines: Prioritize tasks using frameworks like MoSCoW.  

1.8 Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- *Unit Testing*: Validates individual components (e.g., a login function).  
- *Integration Testing*: Checks interactions between modules (e.g., payment gateway + database).  
- *System Testing*: Tests the entire application end-to-end.  
- *Acceptance Testing*: Ensures the software meets user requirements (e.g., UAT).  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


2.1 Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

*1. Prompt engineering definition and importance:*  
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing precise inputs prompts to guide AI models toward producing accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate 
outputs. The importance of it is to enhances AI response quality (e.g., avoiding vague or incorrect answers), reduces ambiguity in human-AI interactions, and 
critical for applications like chatbots, content generation, and data analysis.  


2.2 Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Vague: "Write about space."  
- Improved: "Explain the significance of the Apollo 11 moon landing in 300 words, focusing on its technological and cultural impact."  

   The reason that it works is because:
- Specificity directs the AI to a focused topic.  
- Word limit ensures conciseness.  
- Explicit instructions ("technological and cultural") clarify the scope.
